*** What is Hoptimator? ***

Hoptimator is an SQL-based control plane for complex data pipelines.

Hoptimator turns high-level SQL _subscriptions_ into low-level SQL
_pipelines_. Pipelines may involve an auto-generated Flink job (or
similar) and any arbitrary resources required for the job to run. 

*** How does it work? ***

Hoptimator has a pluggable _adapter_ framework, which lets you wire-up
arbtitary data sources. Adapters loosely correspond to "connectors"
in the underlying compute engine (e.g. Flink Connectors), but they may
bring along additional _baggage_. For example, an adapter may bring
along a cache or a CDC stream as part of the resulting pipeline.

*** What is this CLI? ***

This CLI, based on `sqlline`, makes it easy to experiment with
Hoptimator's SQL engine without creating real pipelines.

The CLI works by running an in-process Flink job and tailing the
results. The Flink job is close to what would run in production,
but it doesn't _write_ anywhere.

*** Show me! ***

Try the following queries:

  -- Adapters are exposed to sqlline as "schemas".
  > !schemas

  -- In SQL, everything is a Table.
  > !tables

  -- Use the DATAGEN namespace to play with fake data.
  > SELECT * FROM DATAGEN.PERSON;
  > SELECT AGE FROM DATAGEN.PERSON p, DATAGEN.COMPANY c WHERE c.CEO = p.NAME;

  -- For testing purposes, you can run pipelines locally:
  > !insert into RAWKAFKA."test-sink" SELECT * FROM DATAGEN.PERSON

  -- There are several commands for debugging purposes:
  > !pipeline SELECT * FROM DATAGEN.PERSON
  > !pipeline SELECT AGE FROM DATAGEN.PERSON p, DATAGEN.COMPANY c WHERE c.CEO = p.NAME
  > !avro SELECT AGE FROM DATAGEN.PERSON p, DATAGEN.COMPANY c WHERE c.CEO = p.NAME
  > !yaml insert into RAWKAFKA."test-sink" SELECT * FROM DATAGEN.PERSON
  > !mermaid insert into RAWKAFKA."test-sink" SELECT * FROM DATAGEN.PERSON

  -- Happy hopping!
